Hi! Welcome to my blog, I am here to write about my experiences and learnings in the fields of mathematics and computer science. 
I have a rich background in mathematics with a master's degree in applied mathematics from ITT Roorkee, in order to explore the straddling world of numbers and code. I also dabbled into software engineering across various startup landscapes for two years. I have had an enriching learning experience with Java tech stack. My love for mathematics made me curious about machine learning and I decided to pursue machine learning as a research intern at the Department of Mathematics and soft computing. IIT Roorkee.
