Hi! 

Welcome to my web corner, I am here to write about my experiences and learnings in the fields of Mathematics and Computer Science. 

I have an extensive background in Mathematics with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics from IIT Roorkee.

In order to explore the straddling world of numbers and code, I also dabbled into software engineering across various startup landscapes for two years. I have had an enriching learning experience with Java tech stack.

My love for Mathematics made me curious about machine learning and I decided to pursue machine learning as a collaborative researcher at the Department of Mathematics and Soft-Computing, IIT Roorkee.
